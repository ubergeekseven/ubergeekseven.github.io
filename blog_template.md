I have the electronics case printed and sanded. I have filled most of the
divots with Tamiya putty.  
I'll have this ready by the end of the week.  
Then I'm moving on to the molding. I will most likely make a mother mold for
this piece. It's fairly complicated and I want to use as little silicone as I
can. Especially with the issue I ran in to the last time I tried to mold a
part of this project.
