I wanted to try and create a 360 render/image viewer that allows you to walk
through it. Ultimately I want to make it room scale if possible. Limited on
time I just started from the easiest part and made it stationary.

I rendered some scenes in blender. I imported a collada of my house design
that I created years ago. Updated most of the materials to work better in a
render. Took a few of my designs from fusion and from Zbrush and imported them
as well.

After upgrading to blender 3.1 I saw that they added a VR viewer. However,
unlike blender XR, you cannot do anything but view and walk around. It is also
limited in the ability to render out shadows and the resolution is not great.
Hopefully they focus on this capability. It really would help to design
layouts. Adding the ability to render and bake out everything into a VR viewer
that gives more of a game engine capability and better visuals would help in
archviz for sure.

First I created my rough property object using a drone and reality capture to
process it. Then cleaned it up somewhat inside of Zbrush. I have a lot of work
on thsi model before it is clean. However, I reduced the size from 7GB to
559MB for better performance in blender.
