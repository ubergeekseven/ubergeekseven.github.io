I spent about a month digging deep into Zbrush. There are a few channels on
youtube that really pushed me into it and allowed me to get very comfortable
with the interface.

In the past while using Zbrush, I would not ever feel the flow like in other
art programs. Finally, with updates to the program that allow me to use the
space navigator and with building custom interfaces, I can really let go and
create.

Zbrush now built in the ability to project a sculpt as a bas relief. I found
that the settings for the base projection method a bit unsatisfying. However,
you can also create an alpha of the bas relief with much more control over
what it will eventually give you. I sculpted a full tree and made a brush for
the maple leaves. Then I set up the camera view so that the alpha for the tree
was in the correct orientation.

I created the sun as a backdrop to the tree. Made a 3d bonsai pot and
projected that alpha to the board as well. This got me into using the geometry
editing capabilities of Zbrush that I have not used previously. The Koi in the
sculpture are from my previous project where I printed Koi for the Avatar pond
scene. I just changed them a bit to work in this project. Created some lily
pads and Rocks for the roots of the tree to grow over. The moon is the same
size as the sun. I used a smaller inset circle to do a boolean operation and
remove the inner part for a crescent shape. Added some craters to it using a
terrain brush to give it the moon surface features. The bottom right corner is
thinner than the reset and is framed by some rocks to make it seem like the
pond is flowing out of the bottom right. The lily pads there are above some
gravel I spread throughout the section.

I decided that the rocks were good enough for the bonsai to sit in instead of
the pot itself.

I decided to try and make a panel that is my take on a Japanese style
painting. It has a moon, sun, bonsai tree and a pond. All flattened into an
odd perspective. Then I carved it using my CNC into walnut that I glued up. I
also made a mixture of bees wax and mineral oil to polish and protect it. That
finish seems to darken the walnut drastically. I love the look.
