I am working on a 3d scanner for a full body.I have a few things complete, but
I still have a lot of work to do. My 3d printer is down at the moment and
waiting for some parts to be machined for me. I have a working turntable but
I'm waiting on the motor to come in. I tried to use another motor from a
wheelchair for the seat raising portion, but the speed on it is way too fast
and when I use a PWM controller to then control the speed the torque is not
high enough. I ended up ordering a cheap one with 4.5 rotations per minute
motor off of Amazon and it should be here in a couple of days.

I have several projects that I am working on at the moment so I'm going to
post pictures and instructions at some point but as of now I'm just going to
go over what I have actually done so far.

Here is the working spinning lazy Susan without any motor. I made it with
scrap plywood I had around.

Updates to come...
