i ran across a diy spot welder and decided to build one for creating heading
elements and temperature probes. I have plenty of the raw material, just
needed a way to do it myself. The cost of manufactured probes is crazy. This
should reduce my cost to pennies.

I ordered the components from digikey and received them today. I'll throw it
together tonight to test and then design a mini drill press like device to
house it and make it portable. I'll post the links to the design and my build
later.
