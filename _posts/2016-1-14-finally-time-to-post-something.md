I have been working on too many things in the past year to do anything other
than the work. Finally I had a little time to record a project that I needed
to do so that I can have better results and be faster at cutting my sheet
goods to size.

While researching cabinet making and then attempting to build them, I realized
that the tools I had were not sufficient. But, I just bought a new house and
buying all of the tools that I want is not feasible at this time. So a nice
sawstop cabinet saw was out of the question.

I ended up purchasing a Festool TS55 and a second rail so that I could cut
sheet goods with accuracy. I was sold after watching many videos and
comparisons. But the people at Woodcraft also sold me $36 connectors to put
the two rails together. The thing is, those things suck.

So after fighting with my rails and realigning them constantly, I stumbled on
a forum post that had what looked to be a very good design for different
connectors. I built them, they are great and now I no longer have any issue
with the rails moving out of alignment.

I wrote up an instructable to cover the build process. [here is the
