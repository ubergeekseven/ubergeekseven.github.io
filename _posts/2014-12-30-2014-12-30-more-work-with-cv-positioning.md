This is an early build to test positioning using the camera of my phone to
track a marker for positioning. This could eliminate drift, if I can get the
frame rate high enough. Right now, I max out at 7 fps. Terrible. But it's a
start and gives me hope that faster devices will be able to accomplish this in
the future. Now if I could only scrounge up the money for the Dev kit from
Google for their CV tablet....
