As a part of my Zbrush learning, I sculpted some funko pop figures of my kids.
I allowed them to paint them after the fact. With my daughter, the hair was
the part that was hardest to do in a way that was printable. They came out
great in the end. The painted one of my son that he did is pretty great. He
took it before I could get pictures though.

I printed using a mixture of craftsman resin and 20% siraya tech tenacious.
The color of the craftsman and the added strength from the siraya tech is
unbeatable.
