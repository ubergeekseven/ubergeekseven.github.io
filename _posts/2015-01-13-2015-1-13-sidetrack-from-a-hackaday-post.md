While reading hackaday, I saw that someone copper plated a 3d print using a
solution of acetone and graphite powder. After quickly creating some copper
acetate from a equal amount of 3% hydrogen peroxide and 6% vinegar and some
copper scrubbers, I had an idea besides the obvious copper plating of 3d scans
of my children.

I have yet to try this, but it seems possible. I will test this tonight and
report back later. So, design and print an object, lets give it some LED eyes
for fun. I guess I could just run a couple wires through a predefined area and
then connect the led in each eye. Or, I could paint on some graphite and then
copper plate the traces!!!! This may not work, but the idea is sound. if the
resistance is low enough and the traces are OK, I should be able to either use
conductive glue or actual solder to attach the pieces. Since you would want
breaks along the pathway for components, you would either have to attach the
cathode to each broken section, or you could paint the mixture on to the
entire pathway and scrape off the area that needs the break for the component.
I will try the latter first.
