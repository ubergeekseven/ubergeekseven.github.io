this works, but I don't like the tabs. They break.

I've been rethinking the design some. So for now, my current change eliminates
the front cover and I also removed the back strap alignment and replaced it
with a strap connector and two straps that are thinner. Much better feel. I
want the front cover to be easy to work with and prevent movement. Optimally,
adding mount positions for accessories would benefit the design.

So far, this is what i have. I've been using the same original design without
reprinting to make sure that i get it right before a final print.

I really feel that this design is close to perfect. Tweaking is needed for
sure and customize it for your device.
