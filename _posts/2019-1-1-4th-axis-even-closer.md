I have cut all the aluminum plates. Spray painted them and mounted them to the
extrusion.

The aluminum was a little challenging for me to cut accurately with the CNC.
Dealing with the fact that I do not have a spindle and the speeds needed to
cut well causing deflection, it still came out well. I had to fudge some
things to get the bolt holes round. I decided to drill them after clearing the
area well enough with the CNC.

Next, I need to design the mounting brackets so that I can reference end stop
positions while the axis is mounted. I want it on there semi permanent, so the
mount is a must.

I redid my spoilboard while I was waiting for some boring bits to come in. Now
I have everything ready to move forward.

Pretty annoyed by how much time a timelapse takes to post process and gather.
GoPro, for how well they work, sucks. I have very little control remotely and
the processing is all offline. I built a Raspberry pi timelapse camera setup
that is about the size of a normal webcam. It has a web server interface and
timelapse is processed onboard. Afterword, I can press a buttoin that runs a
script to upload to google drive and then erase the original files. Cost =
$60. Whats up GoPro? Make stuff easier to do. If I can do it in an afternoon
and design a housing as well as print it, you can to.

You can see the camera on the right hand side mounted to the gantry.
