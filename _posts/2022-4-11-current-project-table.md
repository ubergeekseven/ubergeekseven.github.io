I have several projects I have started. I am learning epoxy resin tricks and
dealing with large amounts of it.

I bought 13 gallons of deep pour epoxy and 3 gallons of some uv resistant
epoxy. I have some ideas and want to attempt to make them.

First off is a table made of Cherry with some very nice curl throughout it. I
dyed the opxy black for the center “river” and created a carved symbol in the
center. The symbol I used is the katet symbol from the dark tower series of
books by Stephen King. In my opinion, the best series of books ever.

**_Ka-tet_** is a term in High Speech for a group of people drawn together by
ka for a purpose

Basically, family. I figure that the symbol is perfect for a table. Gathering
around it with friends and family for a palaver. Tell stories and converse
between the groups and individuals to become closer.

I carved the symbol from ash and placed it in the center to be filled with
clear epoxy. I was working with glitter a couple weeks before and no matter
what I did, ended up with several pieces in it. I will just try and think of
them as the poles of the beams. They are represented in the books as crystal
spheres of different colors. glitter works for that.

I have finished the table. It seems impossible to make black epoxy perfect. So
much polishing.
