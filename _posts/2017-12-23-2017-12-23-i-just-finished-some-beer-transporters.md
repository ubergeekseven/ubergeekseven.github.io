I wanted to attempt making several presents with my CNC. Just to try out
replicating and then building several versions of the same thing. I think they
cam out decent and I learned some things for future projects.

The holders are for 6 beers and I machined a part out of the front to hold a
bartender bottle opener magnetically. I then added the space to put a 6 pack
ice pack cooler in the middle of the beers. Turning it in to a cooler.
Obviously, it is not meant for long term storage, but hipster parties or
something.

I personalized each one and started with this one. My friend, we call him
Bert, got this one. Thought it was funny. Kind of. In a dad joke way.

I created 6 so far. Eventually, after chrostmas is over, I will post the files
for use.
