After creating my Mach 4 manual atc functions, I wanted to update my touch
plate as well. I originally used a bolt to secure the height of it over the
workpiece. This had issues will slipping and it also tilted it slightly. I set
out to understand how to make a cam clamp mechanism and after a couple tests I
now have an easy to print device that holds very well.

I am including my design files for this clamp if you want to attempt to use it
or if you want to modify it. The link is also on my GitHub along with the code
for the screen set.
