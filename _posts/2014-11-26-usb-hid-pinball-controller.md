another project that I've started is a pinball virtual reality game for
Android. So to make this game feel more realistic and give you a sense of
presence I am creat It took me a few days but I figured out how to make the
pull for the ball shooter, and it works, but not a amazingly. I may actually
end up ordering a real pull shooter but I'm going to wait on that for a minute
until I finish the code.

I'm using a full-size Arduino Leonardo for the HID input. Hopefully I'll have
time this week code it and test. Then on to asset creation in 3ds max and then
to unity for game development.

i wanted to use debouncing for my input buttons, but then after researching, i
found that there are a crazy amount of ways to do it. Note i have to find the
best for this project.
