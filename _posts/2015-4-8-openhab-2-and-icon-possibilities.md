In the free time that I have, I am attempting to redesign the icons for
openhab. I want to stay in line somewhat with the material design google now
has on their interfaces. So, I started making my own interface with tasker and
designed icons to work for me using photoshop.

Not wanting to do too much work if the interface for openhab 2 is going to be
updated, I asked if we could have something larger than 32x32 pixels. These
look real bad on pretty much everything today. So I asked if they would be
updated and was told that it has not been done yet. So, I learned illustrator
and created my first set. These include the slider light icons and the on and
off icons needed to replace the current ones in the directory.

The real bad part, this took 3 days to do, and I can no longer look at my
designs objectively. So hopefully I can get feedback from some people out
there about the current designs. I am up to change anything. One thing that
would be nice, is 1% increment changes on the slider feedback icon. Then it
could be more visually accurate to the actual light state.

Anyway, here is what I have.
