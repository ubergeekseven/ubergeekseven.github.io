<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">As a part of my Zbrush learning, I sculpted some funko pop figures of my kids. I allowed them to paint them after the fact. With my daughter, the hair was the part that was hardest to do in a way that was printable. They came out great in the end. The painted one of my son that he did is pretty great. He took it before I could get pictures though.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I printed using a mixture of craftsman resin and 20% siraya tech tenacious. The color of the craftsman and the added strength from the siraya tech is unbeatable.</p>
