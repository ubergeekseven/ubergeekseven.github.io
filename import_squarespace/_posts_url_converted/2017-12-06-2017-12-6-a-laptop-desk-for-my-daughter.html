<div class="sqs-html-content">
<p>I just finished a laptop desk for my daughter after she saw the one I made for myself. Her favorite color, for now, is purple. I used purple dye on the board and will finish it with lacquer.</p>
<p>The wood is just a cheap pine glueup board found at Menards. I am practicing with my CNC and do not want to ruin expensive material while learning. I am having some issues with Mach3 and windows 10. It randomly decides to stop communicating with the ethernet smoothstepper and stops. It shows that this is happening before it does it by forgetting the correct position and burying itself in the table. I have cut into the actual metal beams 2 times already. It is becoming a super inconvenient problem. I may have to downgrade to windows 7.Â </p>
