<p>So, even though i have a million projects I would like to be able to dedicate myself to, I have real matters to deal with.</p>
<p>We are in the process of selling our home and moving to a new one. I haven't figured out machine vision to the extent that I would like to be right now, and it looks like that is going to be even further off now with the new house. Hopefully the problem is not fully solved by someone else by the time I can get back to that. i will probably have to relearn everything, but I did heavily comment my code. </p>
<p>The good news, new shop and new projects that let me learn new things. Since I plan on building our new kitchen and all of the cabinets, my first task is building a table saw/ router table. I plan on converting my portable table saw, in to a fixed base saw. Maybe even making it removable if I feel like it. i picked up a 48 inch 1.5 x 3 inch t slotted aluminum extrusion for $30 and plan on making it in to a new fence for both the table saw and the router. This will be a moveable station, and at some point I may add a couple wheelchair motors for remote control down the road. </p>
<p>Along with that I need to build a good woodworking bench. I also recently ordered the parts needed to make my digital calipers an HID input for measurements. I want to add an Optical encoder for measuring longer distances by rolling it down a work piece. This seems fairly straight forward, so should be a weekend project soon. I want MM accuracy at the least and sub mm if I can get that. 3d print edge guides and attachments for different measuring abilities. I would like to measure angles digitally as well.</p>
<p>For now, I will just fixate on the build at hand until it is finished. I will be posting whatever it is that I start with. Right now I am designing the layout of the bench and table....  </p>
