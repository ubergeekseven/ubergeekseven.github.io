<div class="sqs-html-content">
<p>I wanted to attempt making several presents with my CNC. Just to try out replicating and then building several versions of the same thing. I think they cam out decent and I learned some things for future projects.</p>
<p>The holders are for 6 beers and I machined a part out of the front to hold a bartender bottle opener magnetically. I then added the space to put a 6 pack ice pack cooler in the middle of the beers. Turning it in to a cooler. Obviously, it is not meant for long term storage, but hipster parties or something.</p>
<p>I personalized each one and started with this one. My friend, we call him Bert, got this one. Thought it was funny. Kind of. In a dad joke way.</p>
<p>I created 6 so far. Eventually, after chrostmas is over, I will post the files for use.Â </p>
