  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It's not fake, but you have to fake it to actually make itâ€¦ work. I wanted continuous 4th axis and have worked towards that goal for about a year. It seems something mystical in hobby grade shops, but you can approximate the outcome. It takes planning and thinking through your machining before your 4th acts, to the eye, as a continuous machining path.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The good part about me using fusion 360 to accomplish this outcome is that you can save setups to reuse on other projects. This way, the hour you spend on setting up will benefit you in the future.</p>
