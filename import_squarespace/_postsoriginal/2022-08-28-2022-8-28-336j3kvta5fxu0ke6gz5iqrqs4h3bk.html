  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I recently purchased the ray 10w laser because I've never had a laser. Out of the box, it works well for anyone who wants to keep it that way. </p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I took apart the controller box to see what it was using. None of these Chinese manufacturers actually innovate. They consistently steal open source projects and never attribute the originators. Attribution alone would be fine for most of the projects that get out on the shelf. Even better would be to not only put together a GitHub repository but, post the source.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Longer doesn't use git. They instead make you click links to Google drive shares for the files. If you want to upgrade firmware, they give you the tools and compiled code to do it.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Longer rebranded a board called the mks dlc32 board. That repo hosts the board files. So, longer copied it and put their logo and name on it instead. The mks people have been saying they will upload the surface for over a year at this point. </p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The board itself has an esp32 board on a grbl setup. This made me think about another project I've used previously for CNC control. Esp32grbl has been around for years now and it has morphed into fluidnc. Both of which exist on their entirety on git. </p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It seems that mks just took the esp32grbl code and used that themselves. Longer them took that board design and the code and made their modifications. They didn't modify the board at all. Instead, to get other sensors working and reduce the capability of the board, they made some cables that went to end stops ports and the spi header. This takes away your ability to auto home and to use another axis like rotary.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I spent a few hours looking into fluidnc and by modifying settings for something that looked similar enough on the examples page, I was able to get things working correctly. I can now auto home and run another axis.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">You do lose the touch screen, fire sensor and accelerometer. There is someone working on custom interfaces for the screen now. Eventually I'll see if I can add that back. The fire sensor can be sensitive and some light can trip it. Ruining a job potentially. Especially when homing isn't available. The accelerometer stops it off you bump the table hard enough. I can live without both the features and could at something for fire another way.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I need to enclose it and vent it still. That's next. I purchased some dark green cast acrylic for the window in. I'll add a camera for lightburn as well as a filter system that vents through to the outside. </p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I'm using lightburn for control and the fluidnc web interface for secondary control. I will link to my GitHub for the settings file for fluidnc that will get you a much more flexible setup than what comes from longer. </p>
