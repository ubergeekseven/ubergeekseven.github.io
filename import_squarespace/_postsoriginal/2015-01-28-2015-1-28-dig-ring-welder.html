  <p>i ran across a diy spot welder and decided to build one for creating heading elements and temperature probes. I have plenty of the raw material, just needed a way to do it myself. The cost of manufactured probes is crazy. This should reduce my cost to pennies.  </p>
<p>I ordered the components from digikey and received them today. I'll throw it together tonight to test and then design a mini drill press like device to house it and make it portable. I'll post the links to the design and my build later. </p>
