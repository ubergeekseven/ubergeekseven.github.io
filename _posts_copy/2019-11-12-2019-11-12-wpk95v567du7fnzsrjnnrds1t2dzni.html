<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">a few months ago I started designing some trim, for my kitchen garden window, and I was going the traditional route until I decided to give myself a challenge. In about three months I have been slowly designing this trim for us. I started on one vertical piece that would have Vines growing from the base attaching to a piece above it and growing out to have blooms and leaves. after finishing the first design I decided to try and cut it out before moving on to the next parts. I then spent at least a couple of weeks troubleshooting why the output came out the way it did. At first I used aspire to generate the G-Code for the 4th axis work. That was a nightmare because it only works on one center Line and you have to wrap it. So if you have square areas pockets and other things that need to be reached down inside of, it's not possible. you end up with steps in all kinds of things you would have to work around and maybe you can get something similar done but it's not worth the amount of time. Instead I decided to use Fusion 360 and fake a 4th axis continuous movement. I'm basically using it as a turret so that it can switch position and carve whatever it can carve on that current angle.</p>
